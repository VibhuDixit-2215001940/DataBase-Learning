## üìñ About

This repository serves as a collection of the work and notes I have generated while learning **MongoDB**, a popular NoSQL database. I am documenting the following:

- MongoDB fundamentals: database design, collections, documents
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Indexing, Aggregation, and other advanced features
- Best practices and performance optimizations

The repository includes:
- **Code snippets** that demonstrate various MongoDB operations.
- **Learning notes** that summarize key concepts, commands, and practices.
- **Example projects** that apply MongoDB in real-world use cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with the code and examples in this repository, you'll need **MongoDB** installed on your machine.

### Requirements:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running locally or via a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- **Node.js** (optional, for running the JavaScript code examples)

### Steps to set up:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Database-learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository:
    ```bash
    cd Database-learning
    ```

3. If using JavaScript code examples with MongoDB, install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install mongodb
    ```

4. Follow the examples in the **Code Examples** section to get started with MongoDB operations.

- **CRUD Operations**
  - Insert, Find, Update, Delete
  - Handling errors and validation

- **Indexes**
  - Indexing basics and performance optimization
  - Compound indexes, Geospatial indexes

- **Aggregation**
  - Introduction to the aggregation pipeline
  - Using `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`

- **Transactions** 
  - ACID properties in MongoDB
  - Using multi-document transactions

For detailed learning, please refer to the respective **notes** files in the repository.
